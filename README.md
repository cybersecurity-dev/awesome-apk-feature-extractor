## Android Reverse Engineering Tools
- 
- [Apktool](https://apktool.org/) - Apktool is a powerful, open-source command-line tool used for reverse engineering Android applications (_APK files_). It allows users to decode compiled Android resources and Dalvik bytecode (in _.dex_ files) back into their nearly original, human-readable forms, such as XML files for layouts and Smali code (_a low-level assembly-like language for the Dalvik Virtual Machine_).
